# OpenGL-Project
OpenGL Project (implemented using C++ and Blender 2.77a       3D Modeling : Using blender an .obj file created. This file consists of vectors, normals and faces            co-ordinates created in Blender software.                This file is read in the original C++ program using file handling concepts, vectors, algorithms in STL                Finally the points are rendered using openGL concepts to make the final image.  Solar System :               The Solar System is made using only openGL concepts. The sun is placed at the center with the planets rotating around the sun. Lighting and axis are included. The user can navigate through the Solar System along x, y and z axis using appropriate keys. Other features include Scaling and  Perspective view.
